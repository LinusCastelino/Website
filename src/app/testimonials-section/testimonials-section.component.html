              "I have had the privilege of working with Linus for almost two years for Ecommerce 
              international implementation for toysrus. When he joined the project he was barely 
              inducted in TCS and the project demanded a lot more from him. I should say that he 
              went a long way from there in contributing to the project. Right from the beginning 
              of the project he has shown great ability to learn and grow. Linus is brilliant and 
              learns very quickly. He is tech savvy and proficient with Oracle ATG commerce. He has 
              a great attitude and is always willing to go the extra mile to get the job done. He 
              quickly grasps new technical concepts and puts them to effective use to provide 
              solutions to complex business issues. He is very responsive, and communicates status 
              effectively.I would say that he would be a phenomenal asset to any company."

            "I have worked with Linus for the past one year, as his manager. In this time, I have 
            found Linus to be a smart, hard-working team member. He is keen on learning and picks up 
            new systems/concepts quickly.
            Ever ready to do what is required for the project, we have come to count on him when 
            unexpected events occur in the project and we need flexibility to address the issue. 
            Good at ensuring assigned tasks are completed, Linus has also been a regular contributor 
            of ideas on improving the processes and systems employed by our customer.
            Very good at communicating with all stakeholders, he is a definite asset for any team."
